# Machine Learning

## Overview
Machine learing are methods (algorithms) to computer can self-improving predictability base on training datasets.

Machine Learning is generally categorized into three types: 
- Supervised Learning: each sample have labels (as targets). The labels in the data help the algorithm to correlate the features (most algithmns:  classification and regression).
- Unsupervised Learning: each sample have not label (as targets). Because samples not have label, so Unsupervised Learning only can help to group similar samples together called clustering  (most algithmns:  K-Mean and K-nearest neighbors).

- Reinforcement learning: is training machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns how to achieve a goal in an uncertain, possibly complex environment.

Machine learning is  applied in many fields from business to utility tools:
- Ecommerce: Search Enginesm, Product recommendations, Personalization.
- Medical:  Reconstructing diseases, Hypothesis testing, Developing diagnostics.
- Utility tools: Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, Traffic prediction.
- Beside, machine learning has contributions in the field of artificial intelligence research.
## Concepts

### Model Machine learning
#### Linear Regression
''' Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable. '''
#### Logistic Regression
#### K-mean
#### Cluster
- Loss function.
- Model baseline.
- Metrics evalute.
