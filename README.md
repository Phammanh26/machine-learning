# Machine Learning

## Overview
Machine learing are methods (algorithms) to computer can self-improving predictability base on training datasets.

Machine Learning is generally categorized into three types: 
- Supervised Learning: each sample have labels (as targets). The labels in the data help the algorithm to correlate the features (most algithmns:  classification and regression).
- Unsupervised Learning: each sample have not label (as targets). Because samples not have label, so Unsupervised Learning only can help to group similar samples together called clustering  (most algithmns:  K-Mean and K-nearest neighbors).

- Reinforcement learning:

Machine learning is  applied in many fields from business to utility tools:
- Ecommerce: Search Enginesm, Product recommendations, Personalization.
- Medical:  Reconstructing diseases, Hypothesis testing, Developing diagnostics.
- Utility tools: Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, Traffic prediction.
- Beside, machine learning has contributions in the field of artificial intelligence research.
