# Machine Learning

## Overview
Machine learing are methods (algorithms) to computer can self-improving predictability base on training datasets.

Machine Learning is generally categorized into three types: 
- Supervised Learning: each sample have labels (as targets). The labels in the data help the algorithm to correlate the features. Two of the most common supervised machine learning tasks are classification and regression. 
- Unsupervised Learning: each sample have not label (as targets). It help to group similar examples together called clustering.

- Reinforcement learning:

Machine learning is  applied in many fields from business to utility tools:
- Ecommerce: Product recommendations
- Medical: 
- Utility tools: Image Recognition, Speech Recognition, Traffic prediction.
- Beside, machine learning has contributions in the field of artificial intelligence research.
